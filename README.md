# Daily-photon-output-QA
Photon Output is the one of the most frequently done QA done in radiotherapy quality assurance practice. Though at many places medical physics team are using special
thirdparty softwares to include this QA but still at many centers in developing countries, physicist document QA using calculators and paper.
this program eases that process and saves time.

All reviews are welcome.
